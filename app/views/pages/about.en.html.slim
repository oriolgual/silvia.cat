    p My name is Silvia Puig Brujas, I am an <strong>illustrator and 2D animator</strong>.

    p Personally I consider myself a person with different drawing styles, <strong>I love finding new styles and drawing techniques</strong> and apply them, but especially animation is what I love, not only character designing, but in traditional animation itself.

    p I draw <strong>illustrations with all kinds of techniques</strong>: graphite, watercolor, dyes, gouache, acrylic, wax, tissue paper... and, of course, a whole range of digital tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, Toon Boom...).

    p I've been working on illustration projects of all kinds, because of this I have experience in <strong>illustrating books and stories</strong> and in <strong>publishing and advertising illustrations</strong>. In addition, I've also had the opportunity to work in the video games, from <strong>character design</strong> to <strong>concept art</strong> (defining aesthetics, menus, characters, backgrounds, etc).

    p Animation is my other passion, I've worked both on personal projects (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bk-No8P9M4">Mon Amour</a>, <strong>a short awarded with Cornella City animation and comic 2013</strong>) and professional projects. These different projects I have worked on <strong>storyboards, animatics, backgrounds, props, layouts, in betweens, cleanup or color</strong>.
